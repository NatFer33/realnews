        <h2>Fire Consumes Candy Store</h2>
        <p>The factory of the well-known candy <em>the happy sweet</em> suffered a fire that burned it almost completely.</p>

        <p>The fire started at 8:00 am last Thursday, when a group of workers noticed the start of the fire in one of the machines at the premises.</p>

        <p>Specialized firefighters went to the factory in a few minutes, but the flames of the fire had reached the packaging area, where there were cardboard boxes that were devoured by the fire and served to form very large flames that rose for more than seven meters tall.</p>

        <p>Luckily, the workers were able to be evacuated in a timely manner and did not suffer any injuries, except for two of them who were hospitalized due to lack of air.</p>

        <p>At 5:00 pm, the fire was brought under control, but the premises were almost completely destroyed.</p>
